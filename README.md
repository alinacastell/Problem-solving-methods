# Problem-solving-methods
The goal of this exercise is to consolidate the usage of the exhaustive search, greedy and metaheuristics methods.

The problem proposed aims to optimize the eficiency of an automobilistic production line. This production line contains stations where improvements need to be applied to the cars, each car belongs to a class depending on the improvements needed and there is also a penalization if the number of consecutive cars sent to the station exceeds the established amount. Therefore, given a number of cars of each class and the classes' definition, the cars need to be sorted in order to minimize the total penalization.
